During this week, I just have a glance of the whole official site of Zephyr projects. Read some of the documents in detail,
read the demo codes inline the documents. It seems more interesting than I thought. I would start to read the source codes
from this week and make some notes and comments in my blog for recording purpose.

> A very interesting introduction to the Zephyr, so I move here from Youtube.


Besides, I also notice that there are many new patches in [Gerrit of Zehpyr](https://gerrit.zephyrproject.org/r/#/q/status:open).
That would be a good place to investigate how this software would evolve in future and participate in this process. Nice
opensource projects. Really hope it would break the 'red sea' of RTOS, and form a unified IoT solution in future.
